Welcome to TE2Rules' documentation!
===================================

**TE2Rules** (Tree Ensemble to Rules) is a Python library to explain Tree Ensemble Models by 
extracting a rule list from the trained model. It is an implementation of the TE2Rules algorithm
introduced in the paper `TE2Rules: Extracting Rule Lists from Tree Ensembles <https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14359/>`_ 
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
:ref:`installation` of the project.
